      I used recently is AWS Device Farm, which allows me to test mobile applications on real devices in the cloud. This is particularly useful for ensuring compatibility 
      across different devices and OS versions.</>)

      without a schema registry. I've also used sink and source connectors for streaming database updates from <span className="font-semibold dark:text-white">Mongo</span> and <span className="font-semibold dark:text-white">Postgres</span> into data pipelines.</>)

      I've integrated it with various services to track key metrics and troubleshoot issues effectively. One of my favorite features of <span className="font-semibold dark:text-white">New Relic</span> is the ability to set up custom dashboards and alerts based on SLAs/SLOs, 
      which helps me stay on top of application performance and quickly identify bottlenecks.</>)

      I've used it in various architectures to handle caching and pub/sub messaging patterns effectively. I currently use <span className="font-semibold dark:text-white">Redis</span> to handle caching for complex queries used to determine participant compliance in a study.</>)

I've used <span className="font-semibold dark:text-white">MongoDB</span> to store participant compliance data and audit records because those services didn't need transactions or complex queries but rather high availability. I've used <span className="font-semibold dark:text-white">Neo4j</span> to model relationships 
      between organizations, sponsors, employees and clients as well as cases and referrals that move from one organization to another. These are applications that require flexible data models and horizontal scalability.
